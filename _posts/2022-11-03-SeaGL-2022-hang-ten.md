We are extremely excited for the conference which begins… TOMORROW!

There are a variety of details regarding _how to attend_, _what's on the schedule_, and _why this year's SeaGL is such an achievement_ below. Please take a moment to read and share!


## Attending SeaGL
Since we’re fully online for the third time this year, let’s talk about HOW to actually get online to watch talks and have a super social conference-going experience.

To get started visit [seagl.org/attend](/attend) and follow the directions to join our virtual conference space hosted in [Matrix](https://matrix.org/). Once there, you will be able to join rooms where you can view talks, socialize, and get assistance. Throughout the event Patch—our friendly SeaGL seagull bot—will invite you to various spaces making navigation easier.

Presenters will be delivering their talk on a private video platform. They will be assisted by volunteer moderators (please reach out if you would like to help). Our tech team will be directing that room's feed to a continuous video stream that is viewable within the [attend platform](https://attend.seagl.org/) or website's [view page](/watch).

Each talk has its own room within the virtual conference space. These rooms will move between three subspaces: current, upcoming, and completed sessions. Attendees may join these rooms to chat anytime throughout the conference. Talks are expected to be 20 minutes and if the speaker would like, they have an additional 10 minutes for Q&A, which will be collected from the presentation's chat room.

As a reminder, our [Code of Conduct](/coc) applies in all virtual conference spaces. You can also read more details about the decisions that informed our tech stack in this [blog post](https://seagl.org/news/2022/10/07/Building-a-virtual-SeaGL.html).


## Scheduled sessions
SeaGL has been striving to bring excellent content from a diverse pool of speakers for ten years and we are so excited about [this year's schedule](https://osem.seagl.org/conferences/seagl2022/schedule/events)! Some highlights include:

- Keynote speakers: Aeva Black, Sumana Harihareswara, Lorena Mesa, and Ernie Smith
- Afternoon TeaGL tea-time break
- Evening trivia and mock/cocktails
- Social snacking
- and so much more!


## Group meals
As SeaGL continues to be virtual this year we've been challenged on how to provide social eating events.

The word "trebuchet" might have been hinted at, but interstate lauches require more counterweight than we were willing to lift and there are probably laws against interstate food flinging.

Delivery by carrier seagull might be possible, but let's face it, only the empty containers would arrive.
Heck, just trying to fit them with basket french fry harnesses would probably bust a bunch of safety regulations.

In the end the attendee experience committee decided on revision controlled recipes from the [SeaGL social-cookbook](https://github.com/SeaGL/social-cookbook) for food you can make at home.
These recipes do not require cooking and can be made with ~30 minute of prep time.
Choose what you'd like to make and gather the ingredients ahead of time, then come cook together!


## This year's theme
Last, but definitely not least, each year we poll the community for theme ideas and take a vote within the staff. This year that process lead to…

**Hang Ten!**
