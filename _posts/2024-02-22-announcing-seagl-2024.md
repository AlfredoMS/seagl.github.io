We're excited to share that the Seattle GNU/Linux Conference is returning for its _twelfth (12th)_ year on **Friday, November 8th** and **Saturday November 9th, 2024**.
Our in-person event will again take place in the [Husky Union Building](/maps/2024) at the University of Washington and we are striving to provide a great experience for our remote attendees too (but we need your help, see below).

This year's staff-selected theme is "**Around the Clock**" and we'll be working around the clock to bring you the best SeaGL yet!
An internal goal this year, appropriate given the theme, is to clarify when each conference component needs to be ready.
To that end, we are currently planning on opening the [CFP](/cfp) in May and our [sponsorship](/sponsors/) prospectus should be available in March.

If you (or a friend) have ever wondered what it takes to put these things on, join us and find out!
We realize that our virtual experience last year suffered, in part due to being spread too thin with the return to in-person.
Hopefully more folks will join SeaGL's all-volunteer staff, which is [actively recruiting](/volunteer) committee coordinators and helpers of all levels.

Not quite ready to volunteer? No problem! Please join our [matrix community](/meet) or low-traffic [announcement list](https://groups.google.com/g/seagl_announce) to stay in touch.
And send some [suggestions](/IDEA_suggestions) about how SeaGL can be more IDEA (inclusive, diverse, equitable, and accessible) aligned.
As always, SeaGL couldn't have come this far without our community and we want to thank each and every one of you.

It may be well over the horizon, but we are flying high and looking forward to seeing many of you on **November 8th & 9th** (_if not before_)!
