Well, SeaGL 2021 happened and hopefully we're all [on cloud nine](/news/2021/10/27/seagl-2021-theme).
Our second virtual SeaGL was a flying success!
It was great to connect folks from around the world, sharing our love of free software and free culture together.
And of course, all of the surrounding social events were delightful and insightful as well.

There are just so many people we want to thank!
The keynotes from Marie Nordin, Christine Lemmer-Webber, Dr. Morgan Lemmer-Webber, Elana Hashman, and Cory Doctorow were awesome.
And truly, all of the presentations were fantastic.
Join us in a big thank you to all of our speakers for sharing their time with the community.
Ahem, and if you happen to be a speaker, please be sure to check your email for information about this year's speaker gifts!

SeaGL couldn't happen without our many wonderful volunteers giving countless hours to the effort.
Our heartfelt thanks go to everyone who helped speakers, built our attendee platform, designed our social media images, advised the career expo, and all of the other tasks, major and minor, that went on for months and minutes behind the scenes.
SeaGL is first and foremost a grassroots conference, and our volunteers are what keeps it that way.
If you want to be a part of SeaGL 2022, it's never too early to think about [volunteering](/news/2021/10/05/volunteers-2021)!

Last, but certainly not least, even a volunteer-run conference has expenses.
We would of course like to thank the SeaGL 2021 [sponsors](/sponsors/2021).
In particular, thanks goes to our platinum sponsors—[Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/opensource/) and [JMP.chat](https://jmp.chat/)—as well as our gold sponsors—[C-SATS](https://www.csats.com/), [Google](https://google.com), [Schedules Direct](https://www.schedulesdirect.org/), and the [Ubuntu Community Fund](https://ubuntu.com/community).
Thanks also to our silver and bronze sponsors, our media sponsors, and the many other organizations and projects that helped make SeaGL 2021 a resounding success.

We can't wait for you to join us November 4–5, 2022 for the _**tenth**_ year of SeaGL!
