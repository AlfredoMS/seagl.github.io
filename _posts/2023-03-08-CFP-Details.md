### TWhat we are and aren't looking for

SeaGL is a very special conference.  We're a community-focused Free/Libre Open Source Software annual event in Seattle, and since 2020, all over the world virtually!  

We're an independent bunch but we still like to take care of each other.

We are not looking for sponsored talks, however we'd love to welcome you over at our [Sponsorship Prospectus](http://seagl.org/sponsors/2022.html) and give you an opportunity to reach our attendees in other ways.  As a small community event, our attendees tend to be university students, open source hobbyists and engineers, security professionals, technical writers, and more, skewing toward community rather than a corporate feel.

We're not very likely to accept broad introductory talks, but specific, scoped introductions to a discrete part of the Operations or Network/Sysadmin world are very sought after, and we also love talks on the broad theme of "hacking for good", and personal security as well.  Are you making choices for your personal technology outside of Amazon/Google/Apple/other giants?  We would love to hear about that too!

We welcome talks you have given elsewhere, but if you have, please indicate so in the abstract (a link would be great) and let us know how this talk will be different.
