We are excited to announce that GNU Project leader Richard M. Stallman will 
deliver the keynote address at the 2015 Seattle GNU/Linux Conference. The Free 
Software Foundation [bio](http://www.fsf.org/about/staff-and-board/) of Dr. 
Stallman -- who is often referred to as just "rms" -- sums up his three decades 
advocating for free software:

>Richard Stallman founded the free software movement in 1983 when he announced
>he would develop the GNU operating system, a Unix-like operating system meant
>to consist entirely of free software. He has been the GNU project's leader
>ever since. In October 1985 he started the Free Software Foundation.
>
>Since the mid-1990s, Stallman has spent most of his time in political advocacy
>for free software, and spreading the ethical ideas of the movement, as well as
>campaigning against both software patents and dangerous extension of copyright
>laws. Before that, Richard developed a number of widely used programs that are
>components of GNU, including the original Emacs, the GNU Compiler Collection,
>the GNU symbolic debugger (gdb), GNU Emacs, and various others.
>
>Stallman pioneered the concept of copyleft, and is the main author of the GNU
>General Public License, the most widely used free software license.
>
>Stallman graduated from Harvard in 1974 with a BA in physics. During his
>college years and after, he worked as a staff hacker at the MIT Artificial
>Intelligence Lab, learning operating system development by doing it. He wrote
>the first extensible Emacs text editor there in 1975. He also developed the AI
>technique of dependency-directed backtracking, also known as truth
>maintenance. In January 1984 he resigned from MIT to start the GNU project.
