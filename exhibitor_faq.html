        <h2>Sponsors and Non-Profit Exhibitors</h2>
        <p>
            We will have a small hall with tables available for exhibitors.
            There are several sponsorship levels for commercial enterprises,
            and free tables available for local non-profit or educational
            organizations. Please see our <a href="/sponsors/{{ site.custom.year }}.html">sponsors page</a>
            for details.
        </p>

        <h3>When should we arrive?</h3>
        <p>
            We open the exhibit hall one hour before the talks start and provide coffee and snacks to the exhibitors and attendees
        </p>

        <h3>Where should we go once we arrive?</h3>
        <p>
            Please check in at the registration table in the exhibit hall. A map can be found <a href="/maps/{{ site.custom.year }}.html">here</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>Which table should we setup at?</h3>
        <p>
            Tables are first come, first serve. Just pick an empty table and setup!
        </p>

        <h3>What size table should we expect?</h3>
        <p>
            Tables are standard 30"x72" folding tables. We will also have folding chairs available behind them.
        </p>

        <h3>Will there be power?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes there will! At the registration table, we will have power strips and extensions cords to share the power between tables. We ask that you bring your own power strip if you need more then an outlet or two for your booth.
        </p>

        <h3>Will there be internet?</h3>
        <p>
