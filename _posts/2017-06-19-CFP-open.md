Calling all speakers or speakers-to-be! Our 2017 Call for Participation is open!

SeaGL is dedicated to supporting newer local Seattle speakers! We welcome speakers of **all backgrounds and levels of experience** – even if you’ve never spoken at a technical conference. If you’re excited about Free/Libre/Open technologies or communities, then we want to hear from you!

[Click here to propose a talk.](XXX)

Target Dates:

* CFP Opens: June 19th, 2017
* CFP Closes: August 6th, 2017 - Midnight PDT
* Speaker Notifications: August 28th 2017
* Schedule Published: September 4th, 2017

This year SeaGL is looking for talks in two formats:

* **20 minutes**: Introduce the audience to a new technology, concept, or just recap an older idea which you think is really neat.
* **50 minutes**: Go more in depth! Do a demo! This is your chance to really educate the audience about something you enjoy.

Both of these time slots **include the Q&A time**. Please time your presentations accordingly. We suggest aiming for a 15 minute presentation for the 20 minute time slot and for 40-45 minutes for the 50 minute time slot, but as the speaker the final presentation time is up to you (as long as you don't exceed your time slot).

## Proposal support

Want to propose a talk but want feedback on your idea, proposal wording, talk title or just on how to deal with nerves? The speaker committee is running weekly office hours during the CFP. We'll do everything possible to help you be successful with your proposal and presenatation. Office hour times: XXX

All office hours are held in the #seagl IRC channel on Freenode IRC. Don't worry if you're not familiar with IRC. Just [click here for the webchat](XXX), choose a nickname, and you're good to go!

As SeaGL is a free to attend community oriented conference, we regret that we are unable to help with the cost of travel and accommodation for speakers at this time.

## Code of Conduct 

All speakers and attendees of SeaGL must agree and adhere to the [Code of Conduct](http://seagl.org/code_of_conduct.html) for the safety and enjoyment of all organizers, volunteers, speakers, and attendees. We ask that all prospective speakers review and confirm their willingness to abide by the Code of Conduct terms and expectations when interacting within SeaGL community spaces.
