Is SeaGL the first time you'll be presenting at a conference? Congratulations! We love all our speakers but first timers have a very special place in our heart.

We want your first speaking experience to be a happy one, so we've prepared some tips which may help you when writing and presenting your talk.

**Know your audience**

The SeaGL audience is an interesting mix of those very new to tech and folks who have been around technology for a long time. Because the conference is held at a community college, you can expect the Friday audience in particular to have a large number of students.

Because the audience will be a mix, you can't necessarily assume that they'll have the background to understand your talk from the outset. Therefore, consider having a slide or two of introductory information to lay a knowledge foundation and provide context for the less experienced members of your audience. Give them the tools they'll need to not get lost during your talk.

**Tell a story**

You have great content, otherwise your talk wouldn't have been accepted. But how you organise that content makes a big difference to how well it's received.

Take the time to outline your talk before you write the slides. Make sure it tells a coherent storyâ€“from beginning to end. Check that each section or slide makes sense and that you can transition to it from the slide or section before. Lack of good transitions can lose your audience and make it a lot harder for you to present the material.

**Constructing your presentation**

When you're building your presentation, remember this: _slides cost you nothing_. Don't be afraid to use more of them. Each slide should hold a single idea, no more, and feel fre to extend an idea across multiple slides if that's what makes the most sense for your presentation.

Don't overload your slides with words or bullet points. The slides are there to guide your performance of the material. They are not there for the audience to read.

When you do have words on your slides, make the font size quite large. Your goal is to make it very easily readable from the back of the room, not to fit a lot of text on the slide, so bump that size up!

Animated slide transitions and animated gifs can add interest to a talk, but they also can be really annoying and distracting. If you're using slide transitions, make sure it makes sense to do so for the content and you're not just doing it because you think it's fun. If you use animated gifs, either don't keep them on screen for long or use settings on your presentation software to disable gif looping. Either way, excessive animation on the screen moves attention to it rather than where the attention ought to be: on you, the presenter, and the content you are delivering.
