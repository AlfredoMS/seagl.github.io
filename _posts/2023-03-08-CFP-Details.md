### Talk Categories

We're looking for talks related to open-source which fall broadly into the ten categories below.  We've added examples of past talks for each to give you an idea of what we might be looking for.

If you have a great idea for a talk on open-source which doesn't fit into these categories, then submit it under 'Everything Else'.

- **Community and Culture**: Open-source hardware and software wouldn't exist without the communities that build and maintain it.  This category covers the open-source community and tech communities in general, as well as the cultural aspects of working with technology.

### What we are and aren't looking for

SeaGL is a community-focused Free/Libre/Open-Source annual event in Seattle.  Since 2020, we also broadcast all over the world virtually!  We're an independent bunch, but we still like to take care of each other.

We like to see specific introductions to open-source software, hardware, and tools, as well as technical deep-dives.  Outside of technical talks, we welcome talks on FLOSS alternatives to big tech companies' products, hacking for good, personal security and privacy, and open-source in non-tech domains such as education and art.

We are not looking for sponsored talks; you can take a look at our [Sponsorship Prospectus](/sponsors/) for details on how to reach our attendees in other ways.  As a small community event, our attendees tend to be university students, open source hobbyists and engineers, security professionals, technical writers, and more, skewing toward community rather than a corporate feel.
