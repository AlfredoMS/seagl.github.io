        <h2>Nominate candidates for Cascadia Community Builder award</h2>
        <p>
            This is a new award for a person who has made an outstanding
            contribution to the free software movement in Washington, Oregon,
            British Columbia and Idaho. This award will be given to someone
            for their work to build the free software community over the last
            one to three years. The winner of this award will be someone who
            has have applied deep commitment and creativity to growing and
            broadening the community.  The award is designed to recognize work
            in software projects, non-profit organizations, outreach and
            education, hackerspace, user groups or any activity that promotes
            the adoption and appreciation of free software to new and larger
            groups of people. The awards committee is especially interested in
            individuals who have successfully reached out to traditionally
            under-represented groups, even if that is not the primary goal.
