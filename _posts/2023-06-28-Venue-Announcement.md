We are excited to announce that our venue contract has been finalized and we are well into planning the details for this year's SeaGL conference experience!

Our return to **in-person** will be taking place at a new venue on the University of Washington Seattle campus in the HUB (Husky Union Building). Within the HUB, we will have an expo hall and lounge space, along with dedicated presentation rooms. This means that there will be different talks, tracks, and experiences to choose from depending on your interests!

As usual, we're planning a variety of social events, organized and otherwise, to supplement the programming. These include a career expo, tea swap (TeaGL), and more. We'll also be hosting a Saturday evening participant party (off-site venue TBD) for more socializing once conference presentations are complete.

Travel and wayfinding details about the UW Seattle campus can be found here:

- [HUB location and directions](https://hub.washington.edu/about/plan-your-visit/#directions)
- [Getting around on campus](https://www.washington.edu/accessibility/getting-around/)

The HUB has the following accessibility and diversity features. If there are additional ones that are important to you, please suggest them in [this form](/IDEA_suggestions) and we will see if accommodations can be made:

- ADA ramps and elevators throughout the building
- single stall, all gender, family-friendly, and disability accessible restroom on the 3rd floor
- baby changing and lactation stations

While this year's event will be in-person, presentations will be streamed and we will strive to include hybrid components for social events so you will also be able to attend online. Please note that the [Code of Conduct](/code_of_conduct) is enforced in all conference spaces and if you are attending in-person, so is the [Health and Safety Policy](/health_and_safety_policy).

We hope you will join us in November one way or the other!
